Refactor:
- putExtra instead of setAction

Fix:
- Skips twice on boot

TODO:
- Use progressbar to show time until next wallpaper
- Toggle download on wifi only
- Retry failed wallpapers
- Grab images from RES
- Grab images from next page on exhaust
- Reset time counter on skip
- Figure out defaults

- UI improvements:
	- Favorite button colors when clicked
	- Unfavorite
	- View favorites?
	
Ideally:
- Allow user to adjust wallpaper
